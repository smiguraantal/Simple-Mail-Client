# Simple Mail Client

## Overview

This program is a personal learning project focused on implementing the basic functions of an email client using Gmailâ€™s IMAP and SMTP protocols. 

## Requirements and Setup

You'll need to configure some environment variables to connect the application to the necessary services:

- `GMAIL_USERNAME` - The email address used to access the Gmail account.
- `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` - The app-specific password for secure access to the Gmail account.

The program assumes that the Gmail account is set to English language settings.

To start the application, run the `SimpleMailClient.java` file located in the `org.example.simplemailclient` package.

## Special Considerations

Certain methods in the application may require specific settings or configurations to work properly. 
As this is a learning project, please note that some features may not function as expected without the correct setup.
